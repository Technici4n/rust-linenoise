# Linenoise

A minimal, zero-config, BSD licensed, readline replacement.

- Original code by Antirez.
- Port to Rust by Octplane.



# TODO
- Use fork from oldium/linenoise (when gcc:compile_library supports -l) : **DOES NOT BUILD ON OSX AS IS**
- Split in -sys and normal library
- Merge with linenoise cargo lib
